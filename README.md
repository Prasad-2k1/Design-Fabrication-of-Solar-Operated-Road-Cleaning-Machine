# Design-Fabrication-of-Solar-Operated-Road-Cleaning-Machine
Cleaning stands as a fundamental necessity for all individuals, playing a crucial role in daily routines. The conventional road and floor cleaning machine has found widespread application in various settings such as roads, railway stations, airports, hospitals, bus stands, multi-building complexes, and colleges. However, the reliance on human energy for its operation poses certain limitations. Despite being user-friendly and eco-friendly, there is room for improvement.

In our project, we endeavor to address these concerns by utilizing easily accessible materials at a low cost, ensuring straightforward fabrication, ease of use, and control. Our focus is on providing a superior alternative to the conventional machine. The manually operated eco-friendly road and floor cleaner we propose demonstrates enhanced efficiency in terms of coverage area, time, and cost for the cleaning process compared to existing machinery. Not only is it economically viable, but it also aligns with environmentally friendly practices.

The primary objective of our project is to design and develop an innovative road cleaning solution. This involves creating a detailed 3D model, manufacturing each component, assembling them seamlessly, and conducting rigorous testing to ensure optimal functionality. Our aspiration is to elevate the standards of road cleaning technology, offering a sustainable and efficient solution that meets both economic and environmental criteria.
